the first bullet in allan\\'s list the need for a single set of requirements although the meeting with keith on wednesday  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen will be extremely difficult and time consuming  throughout the meeting on wednesday keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking much like excel what needs to happen on monday from 3  5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen this is critical this does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements also to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture the other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project.i have been involved in most of the meetings and the

units  the land is selling for 2.50 per squarefoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in westsan marcos which now has a moratorium on development.several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexesand for these new units are going to be significantly higher roughly 1.25per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term but by individual room  thisproperty will have the best location for student housing of all newprojects just as the duplexes do now.if this project is of serious interest to you please let me know as thereis a very very short window of opportunity  the equity requirement is notyet known but it would be likely to be 300,000 to secure the land  i

want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself and i don\\'t want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn\\'t seem to be something required for a closing in  the event you

and booking the hubert deal on wednesday and thursday.phillip jim,is there going to be a conference call or some type of weekly meeting about all the regulatory issues facing california this week  can you make sure the gas desk is included.phillip george, below is a list of questions that keith and i had regarding the westgate project: ownership structure what will be the ownership structure limited partnership general partner? what are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what capacity(regarding ownership and  liabilities)? who owns the land improvements? who holds the various loans? is the land collateral? investment  what happens to initial investment? is it used to purchase land for cash?secure future loans?  why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement? when is the 700,000 actually needed now or for the land closing investment schedule? investment return is equity repayment the return of the original investment? is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed? debt which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each  loan? improvement construction are these the only two loans  looks like it from the cash flow statement. terms of each loan? uses of funds how will disbursements be made  by whom? what type of bank account  controls on max disbursement internet viewing for investors? reports to track expenses vs plan? bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses? what is the relationship of creekside builders to the project  do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a  general contractor and paid gain out of profits? do you or larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits? design and construction  when will design be complete? what input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units? what level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting? does creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors vendors and other professionals  such as always getting 3 bids payment schedules or reference checking? are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use names?these questions are probably very basic to you but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me  also i want to learn asmuch as possible from the process.phillip        forwarded by phillip k allen on 09/19/2000 04:35 pm \"george richards cbpres@austin.rr.com on 09/08/2000

proforma for the westgate property is austinthat we told you about  as you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40 per year over 3 years.this is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asaustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market  this is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the austin market.the project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan  asit is in the smart growth corridor area designated by the city of austinfor preferred development this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months  additionally many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived  i have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in northaustin which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening  even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement i used this data to be cautious. the lone star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly  other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at st edwards university.as with most infill projects the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven  we have included a fence around the entire property but mayonly put it on westgate and cameron loop  gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.the seller accepted our offer thursday evening with a price of 680,000 andan extended escrow  this will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract which will mean that we can close intoan a&d loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.this analysis shows your investment at 700,000 for a 50 interest in theprofits of the project  as we discussed in san marcos we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot  i believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project  you would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first  larry lewter knows an expert in the field in sanantonio if you do not know anyone.i will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by airborne express today for saturday delivery.once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area  please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime  you can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110  my cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103   i look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.i regret that it took so long to get back to you but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks  a small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the south part of austin where we are building 10 town homes.one of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day  the severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down  the city shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract  then last week i had to takemy wife  to emergency  she has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week  there is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realizethe enormous number of things she does everyday   fortunately it looks asif she will be ok in the long run.george w richardscreekside builders llc  westgate proforma-phillip

units in the 180\\'s  he does have a muchlower basis in the lots than anyone else but the prime differences are dueto a he is selling them during construction and b they are smaller units.we do not know the exact size of each of his units but we believe one ofthe duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft plan  this would produce an average sqfootage of 1233 which would be 73.80 psf at 182,000  i thought hissales price was 187,000  at this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sellfor 203,108.what is more important in my view is a the rental rate and b therent-ability  you have all of our current rental and cost data for your ownevaluation  as for rent-ability i believe that we have shown that the3-bedroom 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market    in fact if wewere able to purchase additional

     in 1997 a little-known silicon valley company called exodus                  communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in tukwila                        the mission was to handle the internet traffic and computer servers for the                  region\\'s growing number of dot-coms                        fast-forward to summer 2000 exodus is now wrapping up construction                  on a new 13-acre 576,000-square-foot data center less than a mile from its                  original facility sitting at the confluence of several fiber optic backbones the                  exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and eventually                  house internet servers for firms such as avenue a microsoft and onvia.com                        exodus is not the only company building massive data centers near seattle.                  more than a dozen companies  with names like abovenet globix and                  hostpro  are looking for facilities here that will house the networking                  equipment of the internet economy                        it is a big business that could have an effect on everything from your                  monthly

a furious pace in tukwila and the kent valley that some                  have expressed concern over whether seattle city light and puget sound                  energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour high-security                  facilities                        we are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445                  megawatts of power in a little area near southcenter mall said karl                  karzmar manager of revenue requirements for puget sound energy that is                  the equivalent of six oil refineries                        a relatively new phenomenon in the utility business the rise of the internet                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads                        puget sound energy last week asked the washington utilities and                  transportation commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers the                  tariff is designed to protect the company\\'s existing residential and business                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support                  the projects those base stations could cost as much as 20 million each,                  karzmar said                        not to be left behind seattle city light plans to bring up the data center                  issue on thursday at the seattle city council meeting                        for the utilities that provide power to homes businesses and schools in the                  region this is a new and complex issue                        on one hand the data centers  with their amazing appetite for power                   represent potentially lucrative business customers the facilities run 24 hours a                  day seven days a week and therefore could become a constant revenue                  stream on the other hand they require so much energy that they could                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures                        who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates                  in the area is still open to debate                        these facilities are what we call extremely dense loads said bob royer,                  director of communications and public affairs at seattle city light                        the entire university of washington from stadium lights at the football                  game to the medical school averages 31 megawatts per day we have data                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30 40 and 50 megawatts                        with more than 1.5 million square feet the intergate complex in tukwila is                  one of the biggest data centers sabey corp re-purchased the 1.35 million                  square-foot intergate east facility last september from boeing space                   defense in less than 12 months the developer has leased 92 percent of the                  six-building complex to seven different co-location companies                        it is probably the largest data center park in the country boasts laurent                  poole chief operating officer at sabey exodus icg communications,                  netstream communications pac west telecomm and zama networks all                  lease space in the office park                        after building exodus first tukwila facility in 1997 sabey has become an                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or                  development in los angeles spokane and denver poole claims his firm is                  one of the top four builders of internet data centers in the country                        as more people access the internet and conduct bandwidth-heavy tasks                  such as listening to online music poole said the need for co-location space in                  seattle continues to escalate                        but it is not just seattle the need for data center space is growing at a                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country causing similar                  concerns among utilities in places such as texas and california                        exodus one of the largest providers of co-location space plans to nearly                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year while companies                  such as amazon.com run their own server farms many high-tech companies                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as exodus that                  may be better prepared for dealing with internet traffic management                        we have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to                  double our size in the next nine months  yet there is more demand right now                  than data center space said steve porter an account executive at exodus in                  seattle                        the booming market for co-location space has left some in the local utility                  industry perplexed                        it accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth,\"                  said seattle city light\\'s royer the utility industry is almost stunned by this in                  a way  ina, can you pull

midmarkets for socal basis and socal/san juan spreads  i listed the days during bidweek that reflected financial trading for socal index and the actual gas daily prints before and after bidweek    the following observations can be made:  july 1  the basis market  anticipated a socal/san juan spread of 81 vs actual of 79   2  perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91   3  socal gas daily swaps are trading at a significant premium.  aug 1  the basis market  anticipated a socal/san juan spread of 1.04 vs actual of 99   2  perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49   3  gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the monthly postings   4  socal gas daily swaps are trading at a significant premium.    enron online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against the index as well as spreads to other locations  please call with any questions.phillip   alan you should have received updated numbers from keith holst  call me if you did not receive them.phillip suzanne, can you give me more details or email  the plan prior to meeting  what do i need to provide besides headcount? otherwise any afternoon next week would be finephillip colleen, please add mike grigsby to the distribution. on another note do you have any idea how patti is holding up?phillip brad, with regard to tori kuykendall i would like to promote her to commercial manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an associate  her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a commercial manager  i have no doubt that she will compare favorably to others in that category at year end   martin cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as tori  hunter would like martin handled the same as tori. let me know if there are any issues.phillip bruce,can you stop by and set up my reuters.phillip lucy, the rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better  see if you can add these modifications: 1  use a formula in column e  add the value in column c to column d  it should read c6+d6  then copy this formula to the rows below. 2  column h needs a formula  subtract amount paid from amount owed  =e6-g6. 3  column f is filled with the  sign  this is because the column width is too narrow  use you mouse to click on the line beside the        letter f  hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider. 4  after we get the rent part fixed lets bring the database columns up to this sheet and place them to the right in columns j and beyond.phillip lucy, i got your email with the attachment  let\\'s work together today to get this donephillip you have my approval lucy, we can discuss your email later  how is progress on creating the spreadsheets  you will probably need to close the file before you attach to an email  it is 2:00  i really want to make some progress on these two files.phillip lucy,please open this excel file and input the rents and names due for this week  then email the file back. open the utility spreadsheet and try to complete the analysis of whether it is better to be a small commercial or a medium commercial lp-1).you will need to get the usage for that meter for the last 12 months  if we have one year of data we can tell which will be cheaper  use the rates described in the spreadsheet  this is a great chance for you to practice excel.  forwarded by phillip k allen on 04/30/2001

off malin or rockies it would probably make sense to show the basis as an adjustment to one of these point  also what should the mid  offer spread be on these terms.thanks mike wade, i understood your

fewer days near 170  also the second half of april doesn\\'t seem to have panned out as i expected  the outflows stayed at 100-110 at mcnary  can you email or call with some additional insight?thank

basically they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider  then once their sales are large enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit  the risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk  this is my best guess  i will get back to you with more.phillip lucy, i want to speak to

allen@ectcc  subject thoughts on presentationit is a shame that the caiso doesn\\'t provide actual generation by unit  the wscc data which is dicey and we don\\'t have until july 1999 and the cemms which comes on a delay are ultimately our best sources  for your purposes the caiso may suffice  i think that you probably know this already but there can be a siginificant difference between scheduled and actual generation  you are pulling scheduled  if someone doesn\\'t schedule their generation and then generates either instructed or uninstructed then you will miss that  you may also miss generation of the northern california munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso  that is if they have 1500 mw of load and 1200 mw of generation they may simply schedule 300 mw of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 mw  having said all of that it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side.on the load side i think that i would simply use caiso actual load  while they don\\'t split out np15 from sp15 i think that using the actual number is better than the scheduled number  the utilities play lots of game on the load side usually under-scheduling depending on price.i think the presentation looks good  it would be useful to share this with others up here once you have it finished  i\\'d like to see how much gas demand goes up with each additional gw of gas-generated electricity especially compared to all gas consumption  i was surprised by how small the ueg consumption was compared to other uses  if it is the largest marginal consumer then it is obviously a different story.let\\'s talk. check out np gen  load  amw  forwarded by phillip k allen on 06/06/2000 12:27 pm    \\t\\t\\tfrom  phillip k allen

intra-month transport p&l that looks strange to me  remember that i do not know the northwest at all so this may not be an issue but i\\'ll point it out and let you decide  let me know if this is o.k as is so i\\'ll know to ignore it in the future  also if you want me to get with kim and the sitara people to change the mapping let me know and i\\'ll take care of it..on pg&e nw it appears that pgen kingsgate is mapped to a malin citygate curve instead of a kingsgate curve resulting in a total transport loss of $235,019   (if the mapping were changed it should just reallocate p&l--not change your overall p&l  maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects something else somewhere that i am not seeing but anyway here are the deal #\\'s paths and p&l impacts of each.  139195  from kingsgate to malin     182,030)  139196 from kingsgate to pgen/tuscarora       4,024)  139197  from kingsgate to pgen malin        8,271)  231321  from kingsgate to malin       38,705)  153771 from kingsgate to stanfield         1,988) suggested fix  change pgen kingsgate mapping from gdp-malin citygate to gdp-kingsgate. clay basin storage--this is really a fyi more than anything else--i see five different tickets in sitara for clay basin activity--one appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are injections  clay basin is valued as a questar curve which is substantially below nwpl points  what this means is that any time you are injecting gas these tickets will show transport losses each time you are withdrawing you will show big gains on transport  i\\'m not sure of the best way to handle this since we don\\'t really have a systematic sitara way of handling storage deals  in an ideal world it seems that you would map it the way you have it today but during injection times the transport cost would pass through as storage costs  anyway here\\'s the detail on the tickets just for your info plus i noticed three days where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from clay basin  there may be an operational reason why this occurred that i\\'m not aware of and the dollar impact is very small but i thought i\\'d bring it to your attention just in case there\\'s something you want to do about it  the columns below show the volumes under each ticket and the p&l associated with each  deal   251327                  159540                   265229         106300

between commissioners then among ferc staffers  never say never but i think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap  i base this belief in large part on what i heard at a luncheon i attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was ferc chairman curt hebert  although the chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the commission hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:price caps are almost never the right answerprice caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagescompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerany solution however short term that does not increase supply or reduce demand is not acceptableeight out of eleven western governors oppose price caps in that they would export california\\'s problems to the westthis is the latest intelligence i have on the matter and it\\'s a pretty strong anti price cap position  of course hebert is just one commissioner out of 3 currently on the commission but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking the item could be bumped off the agenda

morning  they were polite regarding asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to listen to a proposal  however they are very interested in weather hedges to protect throughput related earnings  we are pursuing a confidentiality agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable us to develop proposals  our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function procurement and by reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a weather product.as to your other question  we have yet to identify or pursue other candidates however mike mcdonald and i are developing a coverage strategy to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our opportunities  we met with 8 entities this week 7 municipals and swg as we implement our strategy in california.are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset management deal that we should approach  otherwise we intend to systematically identify and work through all the candidates laird laird, did you meet with swg on april 27th  are there any other asset management targets in the west?

amto jane m tholt@ectcc  subject sw gasjanie,thanks for the fax on sw gas.we are meeting with larry black bob armstrong  ed zub on april 27th to discuss asset management  in preparation for that meeting we would like to gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with sw  could you in general terms describe our sales activities with sw  what are typical quantities and term on sales  are there any services we provide  how much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them  who are your main contacts at sw gas?we will propose to provide a full requirements supply to sw involving our control of their assets  for this to be attractive to sw we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions  this will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio fixed indexed collars should look like  offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk  that risk may not be acceptable to the desk  i will do some investigation of their pga\\'s and see if there is an opportunity.as to the asset management  do you have any preference on structure  are there elements that you would like to see  any ideas at all would be greatly appreciated.thanks,laird kay  neal,thanks for remembering my birthday  you beat my parents by one day  the family is doing fine  grace is really smiling  she is a very happy baby as long as she is being held.it sounds like your house is coming along fast  i think my folks are ready to start building  we will probably visit in late june or july  may is busy  we are taking the kids to disney for their birthdays.good luck on the house.keith  forwarded by

kristin walsh at 713 853-9510.bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8th deadline due to lack of supportsources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance/bridge loan by the may 8th deadline   any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart  according to sources both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis  the democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for davis  many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund davis would double dip into the fund  clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor  however it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take place  additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 2001  if not the state may be in breach of contract  sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8th having a bond issuance by july 1st will be very difficult.the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately 8 billion  however the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this concession  sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward.currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan ab 8x and ab 31x  ab 8x authorizes the dwr to sell up to 10 billion in bonds  this bill passed the senate in march but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support  ab 31x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts  however sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen currently in ab 8x  senator  bowen\\'s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be likely to cause a socal  bankruptcy  according to sources close to the republicans in  the legislature republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund  for instance tony  strickland has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds or approximately 5 billion  should be issued  other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds  the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  monday  additionally lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may  back out of the bridge loan. key points of the bridge financinginitial loan amount 4.125 blenders  jp morgan  2.5 b   lehman brothers  1.0 b   bear stearns  625 mtax exempt portion of the 4.125 b 1.6 b is expected to be tax-exemptprojected interest rate taxable rate  5.77%   tax-exempt rate  4.77%current projected blended ir  5.38%maturity date  august 29 2001for more details please contact me at 713 853-9510bill sb 6x passed the senate yesterday but little can be done at this timethe senate passed sb 6x yesterday which authorizes 5  billion to create the california consumer power and conservation  authority    the 5 billion authorized under sb 6x is not the  same as the 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward  again the republicans are not in support of these authorizations  without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has  negotiated the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support   no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  sb 6x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power    also there is no staff defined purpose etc for  the california public power and conservation authority  however this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea  earlier in the crisis. socal edison and bankruptcyat this point two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy  the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor  the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15th however some decision will likely be made earlier  according to sources the state has yet to sign the mou with socal though socal has signed it  the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass  if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor  involuntary due to the lack operating cash  the second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond issuance would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31x bridge loan stating that the dwr would received 100 of its payments from ratepayers then the utilities would receive the residual amount  in other words the state will get paid before the utilities  if this language is included and passed by the legislature it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy  socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments.  forwarded by

opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.as far as the business meetings i think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not  too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn   the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format  my suggestion for where to go is austin  play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski\\'s  flying somewhere takes too much time. tim,mike grigsby is having problems with accessing the west power site  can you please make sure he has an active password  thank you,phillip reagan,just wanted to give you an update  i have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12  kipp flores is working on the construction drawings  at the same time i am pursuing fha financing  once the construction drawings are complete i will send them to you for a revised bid  your original bid

are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value  the following assumptions were made to establish our bid  5 daily injection capacity 10 daily withdrawal capacity 1 fuel injection only 0.01/mmbtu variable injection and withdrawal fees  also an undiscounted  june 01 to january 02 spread of 0.60 existed at the time of this bid.bid for a 1 year storage

discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed doors in smoke filled rooms if not directly between commissioners then among ferc staffers  never say never but i think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap  i base this belief in large part on what i heard at a luncheon i attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was ferc chairman curt hebert  although the chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the commission hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:price caps are almost never the right answerprice caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagescompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerany solution however short term that does not increase supply or reduce demand is not acceptableeight out of eleven western governors oppose price caps in that they would export california\\'s problems to the westthis is the latest intelligence i have on the matter and it\\'s a pretty strong anti price cap position  of course hebert is just one commissioner out of 3 currently on the commission but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking the item could be bumped off the agenda  hope this info helps  rayphillip k allen@ect04/25/2001 02:28 pmto ray

fischer/pdx/ect@ect bill williams iii/pdx/ect@ect diana scholtes@ect subject caiso demand reductionphillip et al.,i have been digging into the answer to your question re demand reduction in the west  your intuition as to reductions seen so far e.g march 2001 vs march 2000 was absolutely correct  at this point it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the caiso control area after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors has fallen by about 6  this translates into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 mwa for last month march 2001 as compared with the previous year.looking forward into the summer i believe that we will see further voluntary reductions as opposed to forced reductions via rolling blackouts  other forecasters e.g pira are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 mwa making total year-on-year reduction  2,700-2,800 will come off starting in june  this scenario is not difficult to imagine as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand  given that the 6 decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market and that rates are now scheduled to increase i think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10 relative to last year  this would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 mwa in jun-aug  in addition a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation are being promoted by the state which can only increase the likelihood of meeting and perhaps exceeding the 3,500 mwa figure  finally the general economic slowdown in calif could also further depress demand or at least make the 3,500 mwa number that much more attainable.note that all the numbers i am reporting here are for the caiso control area only which represents about 89 of total calif load or 36-37 of wscc (u.s summer load  i think it is reasonable to assume that the non-iso portion of calif i.e ladwp and iid will see similar reductions in demand  as for the rest of the wscc that is a much more difficult call  as you are aware the pacific nw has already seen about 2,000 mwa of aluminum smelter load come off since dec and this load is expected to stay off at least through sep and possibly for the next couple of years if bpa gets its wish  this figure represents approx 4 of the non-calif wscc  several mining operations in the sw and rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production  i have not yet been able to pin down exactly how many mw this translates to but i will continue to research the issue  other large industrials may follow suit and the ripple effects from calif\\'s economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the west  while the rest of the wscc may not see the 10 reductions that i am expecting in calif i think we could easily expect an additional 2-3 on top of the 4 already realized or approx 1,000-1,500 mwa of further demand reduction in the non-calif wscc for this summer  this would bring the total reduction for the wscc including the 2,000 mwa aluminum load we have already seen to around 6,500-7,000 mwa when compared with last summer.i am continuing to research and monitor the situation and will provide you with updates as new or better information becomes available  meantime i hope this helps  please feel free to call 503-464-8671 if you have any questions or need any further information. lucy,here is the rentroll from last friday  the closing was to be this thursday but it has been delayed until friday april 20th  if you can stay on until april 20th that would be helpful

closing has been postponed  as i mentioned i am going to have cary kipp draw the plans for the residence and i will get back in touch with you once he is finished.regarding the multifamily project i am going to work with a project manager from san antonio  for my first development project i feel more comfortable with their experience obtaining fha financing  we are working with kipp flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings  your bid for the construction is competive with other construction estimates  i am still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local relationships  i will get back in touch with you once we have made the final determination on unit mix and site plan.phillip allen jacques,the amounts needed to fill in the blanks on exhibit b are as follows:kipp flores-total contract was 23,600 but 2,375 was paid and only 21,225 is outstanding.kohutek 2,150 cuatro 37,800george  larry paid 3,500 for the appraisal and i agreed to reimburse this amount.the total cash that keith and i will pay the sellers is 5,875 3,500 appraisal and 2,375 engineering    i couldn\\'t find any reference to this cash consideration to be paid by the buyers.let me know if i need to do anything else before you can forward this to the  sellers to be executed.phillip john,regarding the employment agreement mike declined without a counter  keith said he would sign for 75k cash/$250 equity  i still believe frank should receive the same signing incentives as keith  phillip thanks for the response  i think you are right that engaging an architect is the next logical step  i had already contacted cary kipp and sent him the floor plan.he got back to me yesterday with his first draft  he took my plan and improved it  i am going to officially engage cary to draw the plans  while he works on those i wanted to try and work out a detailed specification list  also i would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners  i will be in san marcos on friday april 13th  are there any homes near completion that i could walk through that day  also can you provide some references?once i have the plans and specs i will send them to you so you can adjust your bid  phillip do you have a distribution list to send this to all the traders.phillip forwarded by phillip k allen on 04/04/2001 07:11

6 weeks  i assure you this is unusual for me.hopefully we can sign some documents on monday  call me on my cell phone if you need me.phillip reagan,i am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?what role would you play in obtaining financing  any experience with fha 221(d loans  although your fees are lower than george and larry i am still getting market quotes lower yet  i have received estimates structured as follows:  5  onsite expenses supervision clean up equipment  2 overhead  4 profiti just wanted to give you this initial feedback  i have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project  as you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate 219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21  i am not thrilled about such a low return  i think i need to find a way to get the total cost down to 10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31  any ideas?i realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections  i am not discounting those services   i will be out of the office for the rest of the week but i will call you early next week.phillip cary,here is the picture of the house i have in mind  i was going for a simplefarmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near wimberley.a few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:there will be a double porch across the back just like the frontno dormers metal roof)1/2 bath under stairsoverall dimensions are 55 by 40what i am looking for is a little

track program  all the desks are trying to use this program to train analysts to be traders  your experience should help you in the process and make the risk rotation unnecessary unless you are dying to do another rotation is risk.phillip  no problem reagan,thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence  below is a list of questions on the specs:1  is the framing lumber 2 yellow pine  wouldn\\'t fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same?2  what type of floor joist would be used  2x12 or some sort of factory joist?3  what type for roof framing  on site built rafters or engineered trusses?4  are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound  what type of insulation in floors and ceiling  batts or blown  fiberglass or cellulose?5  any ridge venting or other vents power or turbine)?6 did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides  i didn\\'t know the difference between an apron and a stool.7  do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking  double plywood or hardi board underlay?8  on the stairs did you allow for a bannister  i was thinking a partial one out of iron  only about 5 feet.9  i did not label it on the plan but i was intending for a 1/2 bath under the stairs a pedestal sink would probably work.10  are undermount sinks different than drop ins  i was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.11  1 or 2 a/c units  i am assuming 2.12  prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?13  no door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?14  exterior porches included in bid  cedar decking on upstairs  iron railings?15  what type of construction contract would you use  fixed price except for change orders?i want to get painfully detailed with the specs before i make a decision but this is a start  i think i am ready to get plans drawn up  i am going to call cary kipp tosee about setting up a design meeting to see if i like his ideas.phillipi  larry,jacques has sent a document to claudia for your review  just dropping you a line to confirm that you have seen it.phillip jacques,would it be ok if i signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and architect  they have both sent me agreements  the only paymentthat george and larry had made was 2,350 to the architect  i have written personal checks in the amounts of 25,000 to the architect and 13,950 to the engineer.i was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the partnership  i would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the

for on-site general requirements  299,818 represent?will you review the builders profit and fees with me again  you mentioned 2 overhead 3    and 5 profit.why is profit only 4 why are the architect fees up to 200k  i thought they would be 80k.what is the 617k of profit allowance  is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost?total closing and application costs of 350k  that seems very high  who receives the 2 points  how much will be sunk costs if fha declines us?where is your 1  are you receiving one of the points on the loan?what is the status on the operating pro

specific features include: stained and scored concrete floors downstairs wood stairs two story porches on front and rear granite counters in kitchens and baths tile floors in upstairs baths metal roof w gutters no dormers) cherry or maple cabinets in kitchen  baths solid wood interior doors windows fully trimmed crown molding in downstairs living areas 2x6 wall on west side undecided items include: vinyl or aluminum windows wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room exterior stucco w stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4 sides   i have faxed you the floor plans  the dimensions may be to small to read  the overall dimensions are 55 x 40  for a total of 4400 sq ft under roof but  only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage   are there any savings in the simplicity of the design  it is basically a box with a simple roof  line  call me if you have any questions 713-853-7041.phillip  forwarded by phillip k allen on 03/26/2001 12:07 pm hunter s

the funds available by friday unless i wire the money  if that is what i need to do please send wiring instructions greg,something that i forgot to ask you  do you know if hugo is planning to replatt using an administrative process which i understand is quicker than the full replatting process of 3 weeks?also let me know about the parking  the builder in san marcos believed the plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code  the townhomes across the street have a serious parking problem  they probably planned for the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.phillip keith holst sent you an email with the details jacques,the agreement looks fine   my only comment is that george and larry might object to the language that the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the project   technically that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required did i loan them 1,300,000  i thought it was less.regarding exhibit a the assets include  the land architectural plans engineering completed appraisal and soils study   most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants  i have been speaking directly to the architect engineer and soils engineer   i am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants  the obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above  do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and give consideration of 5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.phillip  forwarded by phillip k allen on 03/26/2001 10:03 am to phillip k allen@ectcc

ceasehour-to-hour sales into california of between 600 mw and 1,000mw that it had been making for the past week according to bpa,it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meetbiological opinion flow standards but it has stopped doing so inorder to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff the agency said it hadbeen telling california\\'s department of water resources that thesales could cease at any time and this morning they ended.cal-iso reported about 1,600 mw less imports today thanyesterday so it appears other sellers have also cut back.yesterday powerex said it was not selling into california becauseof concerns about its water reserves bpa said it is still sendingexchange energy into california however.more details if available will be included in the friday

we are prepared to sell bishops corner ltd for reimbursement of our cash expenditures compensation for our management services and your assumption of all note obligations and design contracts as shown on the attached summary table cash expenditures total 21,196 and existing contracts to the architect civil engineer soils testing company and appraisal total 67,050 the due on these contracts is 61,175 of which current unpaid invoices due total 37,325.acting in good faith we have invested an enormous amount of time into this project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design and other pre-construction elements as it is a major project for a firm of our size it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or rejected and we are now left with no project to pursue two methods for valuing this development management are 1 based on a percentage of the minimum 1.4mm fee we were to have earned and 2 based on your prior valuation of our time for the first we feel that at least 25 or 350,000 of the minimum 1.4mm fee has been earned to date for the second in your prior correspondence you valued our time at 500,000 per year which would mean this period was worth 208,333 either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40 interest in the project worth 0.8--$1.2mm however in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of 15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead as shown in the attached table this fee plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to 78,946 we still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided however if you accept the terms of this buyout offer which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable then we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both if this is your choice either contact us or have your attorney contact our attorney claudia crocker no later than friday of this week the attorneys can then draft whatever minimal

jacquestc@aol.comcc  subject here is the buyout spreadsheet again with a slight tweak in the format  the summary  presents the numbers as only 1400 in concessions. gentlemen,today i finally received some information on the status of the work done to date  i spoke to hugo alexandro at cuatro consultants  the property is still in two parcels  hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot and is ready to submit it to the city of san marcos  he has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey  in addition he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel as well as beginning the work on the grading  hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete  the total cost of his services are estimated at 38,000 of which $14,000 are due now for work completed  we are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land  if we can continue to use cuatro then it would be one less point of contention  hugo\\'s number is 512-295-8052  i thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions  i spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that  now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by kipp flores can be used.keith and i appreciate you meeting with us on sunday  we left very optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.call me with feedback after you speak to hugo or with any other ideas about moving this project forward.phillip here is the buyout spreadsheet again with a slight tweak in the format  the summary  presents the numbers as only 1400 in concessions. jacques,george finally sent me some information  please look over his email  he wants us to buy him out  keith and i think this is a joke  we still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to determine if it has any value going forward  i don\\'t believe the architect work will be of any use to us  i don\\'t think they deserve any compensation for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were proposing was unsupportable by the market  my version of a buyout is attached.i need your expert advise  i am ready to offer my version or threaten to foreclose  do they have a case that they are due money for their time  since their costand fees didn\\'t hold up versus the market and we didn\\'t execute a contract i wouldn\\'t think they would stand a chance  there isn\\'t any time to waste so i want to respond to their offer asap.call me with your thoughts.phillip forwarded by phillip k allen on 03/14/2001 08:36 am \"george richards cbpres@austin.rr.com on 03/13/2001

compensation for our management services and your assumption of all note obligations and design contracts as shown on the attached summary table cash expenditures total 21,196 and existing contracts to the architect civil engineer soils testing company and appraisal total 67,050 the due on these contracts is 61,175 of which current unpaid invoices due total 37,325.acting in good faith we have invested an enormous amount of time into this project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design and other pre-construction elements as it is a major project for a firm of our size it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or rejected and we are now left with no project to pursue two methods for valuing this development management are 1 based on a percentage of the minimum 1.4mm fee we were to have earned and 2 based on your prior valuation of our time for the first we feel that at least 25 or 350,000 of the minimum 1.4mm fee has been earned to date for the second in your prior correspondence you valued our time at 500,000 per year which would mean this period was worth 208,333 either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40 interest in the project worth 0.8--$1.2mm however in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of 15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead as shown in the attached table this fee plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to 78,946 we still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided however if you accept the terms of this buyout offer which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable then we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both if this is your choice either contact us or have your attorney contact our attorney claudia crocker no later than friday of this week the attorneys can then draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the bishops corner ltd partnership to you

financing request for the sagewoodphase ii project  upon receipt of all the requested information regarding theproject we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market  there are anumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the bank moving forwardon the transaction  first the pro-forma rental rates when compared on abedroom to bedroom basis are high relative to the market   we adjustedpro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we areacheiving on the existing sagewood project  additionally there are about 500+units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the city of san marcos this,we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a seriouseffect on an over leveraged project  we have therefore adjusted the requestedloan amount to 8,868,000.i have summarized our issues as follows:1  pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:     pro-forma                           bank\\'s adjustment     unit           unit rent rent/br    unit rent      rent/br     2 br/2.5 ba         1,150          575           950           475     3 br/unit      1,530         510       1,250         4172  pro-forma expenses were increased to include a 350/unit reserve for unitturn over.3  a market vacancy factor of 5 was applied to potential gross income pgi).4  based on the bank\\'s revised n.o.i of 1,075,000 the project can supportdebt in the amount of 8,868,000 and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x debtcoverage ratio on a 25 year amo and 8.60 phantom interest rate.5  the debt service will be approx 874,000/year.6  given the debt of 8,868,000 the borrower will be required to provideequity of 2,956,000 consisting of the following:     land                    1,121,670     deferred profit overhead         415,000     cash equity              1,419,268     total                    2,955,9387 equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage ofactual hard construction costs.(see attached file mapttra.xls)  mapttra.xls darrell,today i let the builder/developer know that i would not proceed with his excessively high cost estimates  as he did not have the funds to take on the land himself he was agreeable to turning over the land to me  i would like to proceed and develop the property  my thought is to compare the financing between bank one and fha  i would also like to compare construction and development services between what you can do and a local builder in san marcos that i have been speaking with  making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to be in order  i am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural work to date  once again the architect is kipp florres and the engineer is quattro consultants out

george,i am back in the office and ready to focus on the project  i still havethe concerns that i had last week  specifically that the costs of ourproject are too high  i have gathered more information that support myconcerns  based on my research i believe the project should cost around$10.5 million  the components are as follows:     unit cost site work      builders profit($52/sf             7.6 million     land                      1.15     interim financing               85     common areas                     80     total                         10.4since reagan\\'s last 12 units are selling for around 190,000 i am unableto get comfortable building a larger project at over 95,000/unit in costs.also the comps used in the appraisal from austin appear to be class aproperties  it seems unlikely that student housing in san marcos canproduce the same rent or sales price  there should adjustments forlocation and the seasonal nature of student rental property  i recognizethat sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and foot rental ratesthat are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas however we do notbelieve that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.after the real estate expert from houston reviewed the proforma and costestimates his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic  hefeels that the permanent financing would potentially be around 9.8million  we would not even be able to cover the interim financing.keith and i have reviewed the

rather the total cost for the manager\\'s unit andoffice is included as a lump sum under amenities  i may add this back in asa rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.the financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanentmortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for theconstruction loan approval therefore its cost will be absorbed when thisloan is obtained.based on either a loan equal to 75 of value or 80 of cost theconstruction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.george w richardscreekside builders llc  sm134 proforma2.xls

clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit  their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials  then there is a layer of construction management fees of 10  there are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money  but i think the majority of it is profit  finally the builders profit of 1.4 million.keith and i were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit  after all if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors  we were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10 fee in addition to the superintendent costs  george claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using  i reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but i don\\'t think the construction management fee is included.george gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard  i will review and let you know what i think.the gp issues don\\'t seem to be a point of contention  they are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process.let me know if you have opinions or sources that i can use to push for  only true costs  1.4 million.phillip george,please send the latest cost estimates when you get a chance this morning.phillip jeanie,lavorato called me into his office to question me about my inquiries into part time  nice confidentiality  since i have already gotten the grief it would be nice to

individually jeff,my target is to get 225 back out of the stage  therefore i could take a sales price of 740k and carry a second note of 210k  this would still only require 75k cash from the buyer  after broker fees and a title policy i would net around 20k cash  you can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at 740 or higher with the terms described in the 1st email  do you want to give the new braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.phillip jeff,i am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8  there are several reasons that i won\\'t commit to this  exposure to interest fluctuations the large cash reserves needed and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns  what i am willing to do is lower the second note to 8 amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years  the existing note does not come due until september 2009  that is a long time  the buyer may have sold the property  interest rates may be lower  i am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note  guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far.can you clarify the dates in the contract  is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?hopefully the buyer can live with these terms  i got your fax from the new braunfels buyer  if we can\\'t come to terms with the first buyer i will get started on the list.email or call  me later today.phillip susan,raised your issue to

wednesday for 1,000 megawatts of power from powerex andstill faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in thestate high-ranking market sources familiar with the iso\\'s operation tolddow jones newswires.but the iso fell short of ordering rolling blackouts wednesday for the thirdconsecutive day.the iso wouldn\\'t comment on the transactions saying it is sensitive marketinformation but sources said powerex a subsidiary of british columbiahydro  power authority x.bch is the only energy company in the northwestregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the iso paidabout 900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.but that still wasn\\'t enough juice.the los angeles department of water and power sold the iso 1,200 megawattsof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of$250/mwh the ladwp which is not governed by the iso needs 3,800 megawattsof power to serve its customers it is free sell power instate above the$250/mwh price cap.the ladwp has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare themunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess powerinto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high however the ladwpis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging the suitclaims the ladwp sells some of its power it gets from the federal bonnevillepower administration which sells hydropower at cheap rates back into themarket at prices 10 times higher.powerex officials wouldn\\'t comment on the iso power sale saying alltransactions are proprietary but the company also sold the iso 1,000megawatts tuesday  minutes before the iso was to declare rolling blackouts for 1,100 a megawatt-hour market sources said.the iso whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the stateno matter what the cost started the day with a stage-two power emergency,which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5 the iso is havingto compete with investor-owned utilities in the northwest that are willingto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.the iso warned federal regulators generators and utilities wednesday duringa conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergencywednesday but wouldn\\'t order rolling blackouts a stage three is declaredwhen the iso\\'s operating reserves fall to less than 1.5 and power isinterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.but iso spokesman patrick dorinson said it would call a stage three only asa means of attracting additional electricity resources.\"in order to line up more power we have to be in a dire situation,\"dorinson said.edison international unit eix southern california edison sempra energyunit sre san diego gas  electric pg&e corp pcg unit pacific gas electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost ofthe high-priced power.socal edison and pg&e are facing

unfortunately i did not hear from them this week  the are promising to have some feedback by monday  i will let you know as soon as i hear from them.phillip george,the probability of building a house this year is increasing  i have shifted to a slightly different plan  there were too many design items that i could not work out in the plan we discussed previously  now i am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center  one wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms  a laundry room upstairs  the other wing would have a garage  guestroom downstairs with a game room  office/exercise room upstairs  this plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living  i am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west  the center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts  i am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building  i don\\'t know if you can imagine the house i am trying to describe  i would like to come and visit you again this month  if it would work for you i would like to drive up on sunday afternoon on feb 18 around 2 or 3 pm  i would like to see the progress on the house we

repairs  plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs  there are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs.2  what is an outside management firm going to do  a full time onsite manager is all that is required  as i mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning  another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care  if you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite.3  considering 1  2 115,000 noi is not necessarily overstated  if you want to be ultra conservative use 100,000 at the lowest.4  getting cash out is not a priority to me  so i am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash  a 10 note actually attractive see below.my job just doesn\\'t give me the time to manage this property  this property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.sales price  705,0001st lien   473,5002nd

at 115k then cash on cash return would be more like 300   this doesn\\'t reflect the additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years for a higher price.do you want to

would definitely be willing to carry a second lien  i understand second liens are going for 10%-12%.checkout this spreadsheet.these numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes

profit  check my math but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation  at permanent financing 1.1 would be paid leaving only 3 to pay out in the 1st year.since almost 80 of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment i feel the 65/35 is a fair split  however as i mentioned earlier i think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract  just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1  fixed construction profit of 1.4 million  builder doesn\\'t benefit from higher cost rather suffers as an equity holder. 2  5 equity for meeting time and costs in original plan 51/sq ft phase 1 complete in november)      5 equity for under budget and ahead of schedule      5 equity for over budget and behind schedulethis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40 but could be as favorable as 55/45  i realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon.feel free to call me at home 713)463-8626phillip   george,we should hear from the bank in houston on monday.the best numbers and times to

non-gas-fired qfs  the last e-mail i sent includes the latest version of the iep proposal  negotiations with sce on this proposal are essentially complete  pg&e is ok with the docs  all qfs but calpine have agreed with the iep proposal  under the proposal pg&e would retain 106 million of what i\\'m not sure  i think they mean a refund to pg&e from qfs who switched to px pricing the money would come from changing the basis for the qf payments from the px price to the srac price starting back in december (and maybe earlier).pg&e will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the force majeure notices off the table qfs are asking iep to attempt to get some assurances of payment sce has defaulted with its qfs pg&e has not yet  but big payments are due on 2/2/01.for

on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number the storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas and the forecast was for frigid weather traders put the two together anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights \"traders do that all the time they\\'re looking forward said william burson a trader it makes the market for natural gas but the market\\'s response perplexed chris mcgill the american gas association\\'s director of gas supply and transportation he had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994 and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality \"it\\'s a little frustrating that they don\\'t take the time to understand what we are reporting mcgill said as consumer outrage builds over high heating bills the hunt for reasons  and culprits  is on some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at wall street stephen adik senior vice president of the indiana utility nisource recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market\\'s speculators for the rise in gas prices \"it\\'s my firm belief  that today\\'s gas prices are being manipulated adik told the trade magazine public utilities fortnightly in california where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis six investigations are looking into the power industry closer to home observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter\\'s startling gas bills having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes most utilities often with the acquiescence of regulators failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging  a sort of price insurance  that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared \"we\\'re passing on our gas costs which we have no control over said paul snider a spokesman for missouri gas energy but critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers \"there\\'s been a failure of risk management by utilities and that needs to change said ed krapels director of gas power services for energy security analysis inc an energy consulting firm in wakefield mass hot topic consumers know one thing for certain their heating bills are up sharply in many circles little else is discussed the rev vincent fraser of glad tidings assembly of god in kansas city is facing a 1,456 december bill for heating the church  more than double the previous december\\'s bill church members are suffering from higher bills as well the sunday collection is down said fraser who might have to forgo part of his salary for the first time the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating \"it\\'s the talk of the town here he said a year ago that wasn\\'t a fear wholesale gas prices hovered just above 2 per thousand cubic feet  a level that producers say didn\\'t make it worthwhile to drill for gas utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers but trouble was brewing by spring gas prices were hitting 4 per thousand cubic feet just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter there was a dip in the fall but then prices rebounded by early november prices were at 5 per thousand cubic feet the federal energy information administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher but 10 gas was coming below-normal temperatures hit much of the country including the kansas city area and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets \"it\\'s all about the weather said krapels of energy security analysis wholesale prices exploded to 10 per thousand cubic feet led by the new york traders natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world setting the price in the 1980s the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas allowing it to float in 1990 the new york mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices the futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce and big gas consumers from utilities to companies such as farmland industries inc can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use there are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas  and often with little real knowledge of natural gas but if they get on the right side of a price trend traders don\\'t need to know much about gas  or whatever commodity they\\'re trading like all futures the gas contracts are purchased on credit that leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time as december began the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than 7 per thousand cubic feet by the end of the month it was nearly 10 much of the spark for the rally came from the american gas association\\'s weekly storage numbers utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter going into the winter the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing in hopes that the summer\\'s unusually high 4 to 5 prices would drop still the american gas association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient but when below-normal temperatures arrived in november the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient then the american gas association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994 still said the association\\'s mcgill there was sufficient gas in storage but some utility executives didn\\'t share that view william eliason vice president of kansas gas service said that if december\\'s cold snap had continued into january there could have been a real problem meeting demand \"i was getting worried he said then suddenly the market turned when january\\'s weather turned warmer wednesday\\'s storage numbers were better than expected and futures prices dropped more than 1 per thousand cubic feet just passing through some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers among area utilities kansas gas service increased its customers cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to 8.68 per thousand cubic feet and missouri gas energy has requested an increase to 9.81 to begin wednesday sheila lumpe chairwoman of the missouri public service commission said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy kansas gas service had a small hedging program in place which is expected to save an average customer about 25 this winter missouri gas energy has no hedging program it waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills and regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs on friday doug micheel senior counsel of the missouri office of the public counsel said his office would ask the missouri public service commission to perform an emergency audit of missouri gas energy\\'s gas purchasing practices \"consumers are taking all the risk micheel said it\\'s time to consider some changes to reach steve everly call 816 234-4455 or send e-mail

spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit  check my math but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation  at permanent financing 1.1 would be paid leaving only 3 to pay out in the 1st year.since almost 80 of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment i feel the 65/35 is a fair split  however as i mentioned earlier i think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract  just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1  fixed construction profit of 1.4 million  builder doesn\\'t benefit from higher cost rather suffers as an equity holder. 2  5 equity for meeting time and costs in original plan 51/sq ft phase 1 complete in november)      5 equity for under budget and ahead of schedule      5 equity for over budget and behind schedulethis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40 but could be as favorable as 55/45  i realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon.feel free to call me at home 713)463-8626phillip   lucy,here

that will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling  i would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes  if that doesn\\'t work we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor  then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property  this tenant has been here since september 1998 i don\\'t want to run them off.i check with the bank and i did not see that a deposit was made on tuesday so i couldn\\'t

comments/suggestionswe met with gov davis on thursday evening in la  in attendance were ken lay the governor the governor\\'s staff director kari dohn and myself  the gov spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas  he would like some additional thoughts from us by tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following monday  attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed based on my discussions with several of you as well as some background materials jeff dasovich and i prepared  below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals the governor\\'s ideas as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor\\'s comments:overview   we made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration the gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees  his staff has more work to do on the latter but he was clearly intrigued with the idea  he talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level  he also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of california consumers including utility-owned generation which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000mw  he foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by 02 and provide some political cover.our proposals  i have attached the outline we put in front of him it also included the forward price information several of you provided  he seemed interested in 1 the buy down of significant demand 2 the state setting a goal of x000 mw of new generation by a date certain 3 getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4 setting up a group of rate analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities  he was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding ldc gas purchases   as already mentioned he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.his ideas  the gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming  some of these ideas would require legislative action.state may build or make build/transfer arrangements a couple of generation plants  the gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases  this was a frequently recurring theme.utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers.municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in california.state universities including uc/csu and the community colleges would more widely deploy distributed generation.expand in-state gas production.take state lands gas royalties in kind.negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies.empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time.condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.either eliminate the iso or sharply curtail its function  he wants to hear more about how nordpool works(jeff someone in schroeder\\'s group should be able to help out here).wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state  we made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without

these files let me know and i can fax them to you   let\\'s talk later today.phillipp.s  please remember to get jim murnan the info he needs. gentlemen, i continue to speak to an attorney for help with the investment structure and a mortgage broker for help with the financing  regarding the financing i am working with jim murnan at pinnacle mortgage here in houston  i have sent him some information on the project but he needs financial information on you  can you please send it to him  his contact information is  phone (713)781-5810 fax 713)781-6614 and email jim123@pdq.net. i know larry has been working with a bank and they need my information  i hope to pull that together this afternoon. i took the liberty of calling thomas reames from the frog pond document  he was positive about his experience overall  he did not seem pleased with the bookkeeping or information flow to the investor  i think we should discuss these procedures in advance. let\\'s continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur.phillip jim, i would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project i described to you last week  the project is a 134 unit apartment complex in san marcos  there will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a couple of other investors involved  as i mentioned last week i would like to find interim financing land construction semi-perm that does not require the investors to personally guarantee  if there is a creative way to structure the deal i would like to hear your suggestions  one idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a forward commitment in order to reduce the equity required  i would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed  specifically the transition from interim to permanent financing  i could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks  i am faxing you a project summary  and i will have the builder/developer email or fax his financial statement to you. let me know what else you need  the land is scheduled to close mid january.phillip allen jeff,everything should be done for closing on the leander deal on the 29th  i have fed ex\\'d the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out tomorrow    when will more money be required  escrow for roads  utility connections  other rezoning costs  what about property taxes  the burnet land lost its ag exemption while i owned it  are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this property  can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes once the property is rezoned  do we need to find a farmer and give him grazing rights?what are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and annexing  i am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and american multifamily walking on this deal  so i just want to make sure we are pushing the process as fast as we can.phillip steve,i am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail  if you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.as far as recommendations here is a short list: 1  examine ldc\\'s incentive rate program  current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future       replacement cost  the result is that the ldc\\'s sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.                    this creates a shortage in later months. 2  california has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand  investigate why it wasn\\'t maximized operationally                        specific questions should include    1  why in march 00-may 00  weren\\'t total system receipts higher in order to fill storage?  2  why are there so many examples of ofo\\'s on weekends that push away too much gas from socal\\'s system         i believe socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand  they repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than their injection capablity but injected far less. 3  similar to the power market  there is too much benchmarking to short term prices  not enough forward hedging is done by the major                     ldcs  by design the customers are short at a floating rate  this market has been long historically  it has been a buyers market and the      consumer has benefitted  call me if you need any more input.phillip lucy, here is a rentroll for this week  the one you sent for 11/24 looked good  it seems like most people are paying on time  did you rent an efficiency to the elderly woman on a fixed income  go ahead a use your judgement on the rent prices for the vacant units  if you need to lower the rent by 10 or $20 to get things full go ahead. i will

the appraiser  note that theconstruction management fee cmf is stated at 12.5 rather than ourstandard rate of 10  this will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratioof 75 this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.also we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costsare high  therefore we should have some additional room once we haveactual bids as the met project next door is reported to have cost 49 psfwithout overhead or cmf which is 54-55 with cmf.it appears that the cash equity will be 1,784,876  however i am fairlysure that we can get this project done with 1.5mm.i hope to finish the proforma today  the rental rates that we project are$1250 for the 3 ada units 1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and 1425 for the 3bedroom  additional revenues could be generated by building detachedgarages which would rent for 50-75 per month.  winmail.dat  forwarded by phillip k allen on 11/16/2000 02:51 pm to faith killen@ectcc  subject re west gas 2001

regarding the authorization for the= bond issuance/bridge loan by the may 8th deadline   any possibility for a= deal has reportedly fallen apart  according to sources both the republic=ans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis  the democratic cauc=us is reportedly unwilling to fight for davis  many legislative republic=ans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that o=nce the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund davis would double= dip into the fund  clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=islature and the governor  however it is believed once davis discloses th=e details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take plac=e  additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=g-term power contracts as opposed to those still in development require t=hat the bond issuance happen by july 1 2001  if not the state may be in breach of contract  sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=e bridge loan legislation by may 8th having a bond issuance by july 1st wi=ll be very difficult.the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=e would eat the 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general= fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 billion  however the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this concession  sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for ful=l disclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated before they= will support the bond issuance to go forward.currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan ab 8x and ab 31x  ab 8x authorizes the dwr to sell up to 10 billion in bonds  this bi=ll passed the senate in march but has stalled in the assembly due to a lac=k of republican support  ab 31x deals with energy conservation programs fo=r community college districts  however sources report this bill may be am=ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen curre=ntly in ab 8x  senator  bowen\\'s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be li=kely to cause a socal  bankruptcy).=20=20according to sources close to the republicans in  the legislature republic=ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund  for instance tony  strickland has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds or approximately 5 billion  should be issued  other republ=icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds  the republicans intend= to bring this up in debate on  monday  additionally lehman brothers repo=rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=ications that lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.=20key points of the bridge financinginitial loan amount:=09$4.125 blenders:=09=09jp morgan=09=09$2.5

senate yesterday but little can be done at this timethe senate passed sb 6x yesterday which authorizes 5  billion to create t=he california consumer power and conservation  authority    the 5 billion= authorized under sb 6x is not the  same as the 5 billion that must be aut=horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased or the addi=tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward  again the republicans are not in support of these authoriz=ations  without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has  negotiated the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support   no f=urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  sb 6x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=ing power    also there is no staff defined purpose etc for  the calif=ornia public power and conservation authority  however this can  be consi=dered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea  earl=ier in the crisis.=20socal edison and bankruptcyat this point two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy  t=he first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor  the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is au=gust 15th however some decision will likely be made earlier  according t=o sources the state has yet to sign the mou with socal though socal has s=igned it  the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davi=s and the senate lack the votes needed to pass  if the legislature indicat=es that it will not pas the mou socal would likely file for voluntary bank=ruptcy or its creditor  involuntary due to the lack operating cash 20the second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond is=suance would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31x bridge loan s=tating that the dwr would received 100 of its payments from ratepayers th=en the utilities would receive the residual amount  in other words the st=ate will get paid before the utilities  if this language is included and p=assed by the legislature it appears likely that socal will likely file for= bankruptcy  socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and= the dwr proportionately from rate payments.

the san marcos project is sounding very attractive  i have one other investor in addition to keith that has interest  some additional background information on larry and yourself would be helpful. background questions:  please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in creekside. please list projects completed during the last 5 years  include the project description investors business entity  please provide the names and numbers of prior investors. please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on recent projects. with regard to the proposed investment structure i would suggest a couple of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between creekside and the investors  preferable investment structure: developers guarantee note not investors. preferred rate of return 10 must be achieved before any profit sharing. builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.         since this project appears so promising it seems like we should tackle these issues now  these questions are not intended to be offensive in any way  it is my desire to build a successful project with creekside that leads to future opportunities  i  am happy to provide you with any information that you need to evaluate myself or keith as a business partner.sincerely,phillip allen  bob, patti sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while randy gay was on a personal leave  she displayed a tremendous amount of commitment to the west desk during that time  she frequently came to work before 4 am to prepare operations reports  patti worked 7 days a week during this time  if long hours were not enough there was a pipeline explosion during this time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on patti  she didn\\'t crack and provided much needed info during this time. patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr specialist  based on her heroic efforts she deserves a pbr  let me know what is an acceptable cash amount.phillip andy, please assign a user name to randy gay.thank you,phillip andy, i spoke to john l and he ok\\'d one of each new electronic system for the west desk

<clclegal2@aol.com subject investment structurestructure:typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate or llc)general partner  the general partner owns 1 of the project and carries theliability of construction.land ownership  loansthe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership  each of the individual investors andall of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee theloans  if the investor(s do not sign on the loans this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profitsis reduced.all loans for residential construction that are intended for re-sale arefull recourse loans  if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.use of initial investmentthe initial investment is used for land deposit engineering architectural design soils tests surveys filing fees legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation  and appraisals  unlikemany real estate investment programs none of the funds are used for fees tocreekside builders llc  these professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.early land coststhe 4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing  as an alternative we can close into a land loan atprobably 70 of appraised value  with a land value equal to the purchaseprice of 680,000 this would mean a land loan of 476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of 3,966 given a 10 annual interest rate plusapproximately 1.25 of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.equity at improvement loanonce the site plan is approved by the city of austin the city will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements referred to asthe fiscals  this cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by coa  this release will befor 90 of the cost with the remaining 10 released one year aftercompletion  releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction  these fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit  as such they have to be counted as adevelopment cost even though they are not spent  because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.the lot improvement loan is typically 75 of the appraised value of afinished lot which i suspect will be at least 20,000 and potentially ashigh as 25,000  this would produce a loan amount of  15,000 on 20,000per lot  with estimated per lot improvement costs of 9,000 fiscals at$2,000 and the land cost at 8,000  total improved lot cost is 19,000which means 0 to 4,000 per lot in total equity  the investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs  thus the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be 0-$184,000   even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side  the engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.phasing works as follows  if the first phase was say 40 units the totallot improvement cost might average 31,000 per lot   of this probably$13,000 would be for improvements and 19,000 for the land cost  theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts the entry road water treatment costs perimeter fencing andlandscaping and so on as well as for 100 of the land  the land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70 of the appraised raw lot value which i wouldestimate as 10,000 per lot for a loan value of 7,000 per lot  then theloan value for each improved lot would be 15,000 per lot  this would giveyou a total loan of 992,000 total cost of 1,232,645 for equity requiredof 241,000  this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.construction loansthere are three types of  construction loans  first is a speculative(spec loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity  second  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name  third is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer  we expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer  we do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.spec loans will be for 70 to 75 of value and construction loans forpre-sold units if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender  willbe from 80 to 95 of value.disbursementsdisbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current andnear term third party costs then to necessary reserves then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement  the general partnerwill contract with creekside builders llc to construct the units and thefee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15 of the direct hard cost excluding land financing and sales costs.these fees are the only monies to creekside larry lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit except for a direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform  for example if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub orcannot find enough trim carpenters etc and it decides to undertake thisfunction it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.finally cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others  at present cb does not ownany significant equipment but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing cornice roofing and drywall spreading.reportingwe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs plan.what did

requirements let me know.then let me know your interest level in the westgate project?san marcosthe property across the street from the sagewood units in san marcos is forsale and approved for 134 units  the land is selling for 2.50 per squarefoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in westsan marcos which now has a moratorium on development.several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexesand for these new units are going to be significantly higher roughly 1.25per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term but by individual room  thisproperty will have the best location for student housing of all newprojects just as the duplexes do now.if this project is of serious interest to you please let me know as thereis a very very short window of opportunity  the equity requirement is notyet known but it would be likely to be 300,000 to secure the land  i

appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both september 26 and 27 and paid above market prices 4.70-$4.80 for san juan gas  at the time of these trades offers for physical gas at significantly 10 to 15 cents lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation  additionally these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for san juan. we have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from september 25 to september 27  these are the complete list of trades from enron online eol enron\\'s direct phone conversations and three brokerage firms amerex apb and prebon  please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary  we have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of san juan based on several spread relationships  the two key points from this data are as follows: 1  the high physical prices on the 26th  27th 4.75,4,80 are much greater than the high financial trades 4.6375,4.665 on those days  2  the spread relationship between san juan and other points socal  northwest  is  consistent between the end of september and

reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70\\'s and these trades are outliers  i wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid

to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer  we do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.spec loans will be for 70 to 75 of value and construction loans forpre-sold units if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender  willbe from 80 to 95 of value.disbursementsdisbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current andnear term third party costs then to necessary reserves then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement  the general partnerwill contract with creekside builders llc to construct the units and thefee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15 of the direct hard cost excluding land financing and sales costs.these fees are the only monies to creekside larry lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit except for a direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform  for example if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub orcannot find enough trim carpenters etc and it decides to undertake thisfunction it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.finally cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others  at present cb does not ownany significant equipment but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing cornice roofing and drywall spreading.reportingwe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs plan.what did you have in mind  i would like to use some

do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.spec loans will be for 70 to 75 of value and construction loans forpre-sold units if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender  willbe from 80 to 95 of value.disbursementsdisbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current andnear term third party costs then to necessary reserves then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement  the general partnerwill contract with creekside builders llc to construct the units and thefee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15 of the direct hard cost excluding land financing and sales costs.these fees are the only monies to creekside larry lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit except for a direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform  for example if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub orcannot find enough trim carpenters etc and it decides to undertake thisfunction it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.finally cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others  at present cb does not ownany significant equipment but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing cornice roofing and drywall spreading.reportingwe are

to be accommodating.creekside proceedurescb procedures for dealing with subs vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates  in the extremely tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible  for the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport  finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.pre-selected professionals

hubert deal on wednesday and thursday.phillip george, below is a list of questions that keith and i had regarding the westgate project: ownership structure what will be the ownership structure limited partnership general partner? what are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what capacity(regarding ownership and  liabilities)? who owns the land improvements? who holds the various loans? is the land collateral? investment  what happens to initial investment? is it used to purchase land for cash?secure future loans?  why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement? when is the 700,000 actually needed now or for the land closing investment schedule? investment return is equity repayment the return of the original investment? is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed? debt which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each  loan? improvement construction are these the only two loans  looks like it from the cash flow statement. terms of each loan? uses of funds how will disbursements be made  by whom? what type of bank account  controls on max disbursement internet viewing for investors? reports to track expenses vs plan? bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses? what is the relationship of creekside builders to the project  do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a  general contractor and paid gain out of profits? do you or larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits? design and construction  when will design be complete? what input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units? what level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting? does creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors vendors and other professionals  such as always getting 3 bids payment schedules or reference checking? are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use names?these questions are probably very basic to you but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me  also i want to learn asmuch as possible from the process.phillip        forwarded by phillip k allen on 09/19/2000 04:35 pm \"george richards cbpres@austin.rr.com on 09/08/2000

aware that regan lehman the lot developer for the entire 70 lotduplex project was selling his units in the 180\\'s  he does have a muchlower basis in the lots than anyone else but the prime differences are dueto a he is selling them during construction and b they are smaller units.we do not know the exact size of each of his units but we believe one ofthe duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft

important in my view is a the rental rate and b therent-ability  you have all of our current rental and cost data for your ownevaluation  as for rent-ability i believe that we have shown that

theadjoining single family residential and a project at st edwards university.as with most infill projects the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven  we have included a fence around the entire property but mayonly put it on westgate and cameron loop  gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.the seller accepted our offer thursday evening with a price of 680,000 andan extended escrow  this will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract which will mean that we can close intoan a&d loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.this analysis shows your investment at 700,000 for a 50 interest in theprofits of the project  as we discussed in san marcos we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot  i believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project  you would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first  larry lewter knows an expert in the field in sanantonio if you do not know anyone.i will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by airborne express today for saturday delivery.once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area  please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime  you can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110  my cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103   i look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.i regret that it took so long to get back to you but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks  a small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the south part of austin where we are building 10 town homes.one of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day  the severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down  the city shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract  then last week i had to takemy wife  to emergency  she has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week  there is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realizethe enormous number of things she does everyday   fortunately it looks asif she will be ok in the long run.george w richardscreekside builders llc

subject internet data gain is a major power drain on                  local utilities                    september 05 2000                    in 1997 a little-known silicon valley company called exodus                  communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in tukwila                        the mission was to handle the internet traffic and computer servers for the                  region\\'s growing number of dot-coms                        fast-forward to summer 2000 exodus is now wrapping up construction                  on a new 13-acre 576,000-square-foot data center less than a mile from its                  original facility sitting at the confluence of several fiber optic backbones the                  exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and eventually                  house internet servers for firms such as avenue a microsoft and onvia.com                        exodus is not the only company building massive data centers near seattle.                  more than a dozen companies  with names like abovenet globix and                  hostpro  are looking for facilities here that will house the networking                  equipment of the internet economy                        it is a big business that could have an effect on everything from your                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access your favorite web sites.                       data centers also known as co-location facilities and server farms are                  sprouting at such a furious pace in tukwila and the kent valley that some                  have expressed concern over whether seattle city light and puget sound                  energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour high-security                  facilities                        we are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445                  megawatts of power in a little area near southcenter mall said karl                  karzmar manager of revenue requirements for puget sound energy that is                  the equivalent of six oil refineries                        a relatively new phenomenon in the utility business the rise of the internet                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads                        puget sound energy last week asked the washington utilities and                  transportation commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers the                  tariff is designed to protect the company\\'s existing residential and business                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support                  the projects those base stations could cost as much as 20 million each,                  karzmar said                        not to be left behind seattle city light plans to bring up the data center                  issue on thursday at the seattle city council meeting                        for the utilities that provide power to homes businesses and schools in the                  region this is a new and complex issue                        on one hand the data centers  with their amazing appetite for power                   represent potentially lucrative business customers the facilities run 24 hours a                  day seven days a week and therefore could become a constant revenue                  stream on the other hand they require so much energy that they could                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures                        who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates                  in the area is still open to debate                        these facilities are what we call extremely dense loads said bob royer,                  director of communications and public affairs at seattle city light                        the entire university of washington from stadium lights at the football                  game to the medical school averages 31 megawatts per day we have data                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30 40 and 50 megawatts                        with more than 1.5 million square feet the intergate complex in tukwila is                  one of the biggest data centers sabey corp re-purchased the 1.35 million                  square-foot intergate east facility last september from boeing space                   defense in less than 12 months the developer has leased 92 percent of the                  six-building complex to seven different co-location companies                        it is probably the largest data center park in the country boasts laurent                  poole chief operating officer at sabey exodus icg communications,                  netstream communications pac west telecomm and zama networks all                  lease space in the office park                        after building exodus first tukwila facility in 1997 sabey has become an                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or                  development in los angeles spokane and denver poole claims his firm is                  one of the top four builders of internet data centers in the country                        as more people access the internet and conduct bandwidth-heavy tasks                  such as listening to online music poole said the need for co-location space in                  seattle continues to escalate                        but it is not just seattle the need for data center space is growing at a                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country causing similar                  concerns among utilities in places such as texas and california                        exodus one of the largest providers of co-location space plans to nearly                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year while companies                  such as amazon.com run their own server farms many high-tech companies                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as exodus that                  may be better prepared for dealing with internet traffic management                        we have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to                  double our size in the next nine months  yet there is more demand right now                  than data center space said steve porter an account executive at exodus in                  seattle                        the booming market for co-location space has left some in the local utility                  industry perplexed                        it accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the

regard to tori kuykendall i would like to promote her to commercial manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an associate  her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a commercial manager  i have no doubt that she will compare favorably to others in that category at year end   martin cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as tori  hunter would like martin handled the same as tori. let me know if there are any issues.phillip bruce,can you stop by and set up my reuters.phillip if you cannot read this email please click here

roll spreadsheet is starting to look better  see if you can add these modifications: 1  use a formula in column e  add the value in column c to column d  it should read c6+d6  then copy this formula to the rows below. 2  column h needs a formula  subtract amount paid from amount owed  =e6-g6. 3  column f is filled with the  sign  this is because the column width is too narrow  use you mouse to click on the line beside the        letter f  hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider. 4  after we get the rent part fixed lets bring the database columns up to this sheet and place them to the right in columns j and beyond.phillip lucy, i got your email with the attachment  let\\'s work together today to get this donephillip you have my approval lucy, we can discuss your email later  how is progress on creating the spreadsheets  you will probably need to close the file before you attach to an email  it is 2:00  i really want to make some progress on these two files.phillip lucy,please open this excel file and input the rents and names due for this week  then email the file back. open the utility spreadsheet and try to complete the analysis of whether it is better to be a small commercial or a medium commercial lp-1).you will need to get the usage for that meter for the last 12 months  if we have one year of data we can tell which will be cheaper  use the rates described in the spreadsheet  this is a great chance for you to practice excel. mac, thanks for the research report on eog  here are my observations:  gas sales 916,000/day x 365 days

1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst  2.86 additional eps x 12 p/e multiple  34 a share that is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices  i think crude price are undervalued by the tune of

questions but i want to get the exact details from him  basically they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider  then once their sales are large enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit  the risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk  this is my best guess  i will get back to you with more.phillip lucy, i want to speak to wade myself  he can call me at work or home or if you email me his number i will call him   i would like gary to direct wade on renovation tasks and you can give him work orders for normal maintenance. i will call you tomorrow to discuss items from the office  do you need mary to come in on any more fridays  i think i  can guess your

   06/11/2000 07:26 pm\\tto phillip k allen@ectcc  subject thoughts on presentationit is a shame that the caiso doesn\\'t provide actual generation by unit  the wscc data which is dicey and we don\\'t have until july 1999 and the cemms which comes on a delay are ultimately our best sources  for your purposes the caiso may suffice  i think that you probably know this already but there can be a siginificant difference between scheduled and actual generation  you are pulling scheduled  if someone doesn\\'t schedule their generation and then generates either instructed or uninstructed then you will miss that  you may also miss generation of the northern california munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso  that is if they have 1500 mw of load and 1200 mw of generation they may simply schedule 300 mw of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 mw  having said all of that it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side.on the load side i think that i would simply use caiso actual load  while they don\\'t split out np15 from sp15 i think that using the actual number is better than the scheduled number  the utilities play lots of game on the load side usually under-scheduling depending on price.i think the presentation looks good  it would be useful to share this with others up here once you have it finished  i\\'d like to see how much gas demand goes up with each additional gw of gas-generated electricity especially compared to all gas consumption  i was surprised by how small the ueg consumption was compared to other uses  if it is the largest marginal consumer then it is obviously a different story.let\\'s talk. check out np gen  load  amw  forwarded by phillip k allen on 06/06/2000 12:27 pm    \\t\\t\\tfrom  phillip

transport p&lphillip--i\\'ve noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strange to me  remember that i do not know the northwest at all so this may not be an issue but i\\'ll point it out and let you decide  let me know if this is o.k as is so i\\'ll know to ignore it in the future  also if you want me to get with kim and the sitara people to change the mapping let me know and i\\'ll take care of it..on pg&e nw it appears that pgen kingsgate is mapped to a malin citygate curve instead of a kingsgate curve resulting in a total transport loss of $235,019   (if the mapping were changed it should just reallocate p&l--not change your overall p&l  maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects something else somewhere that i am not seeing but anyway here are the deal #\\'s paths and p&l impacts of each.  139195  from kingsgate to malin     182,030)  139196 from kingsgate to pgen/tuscarora       4,024)  139197  from kingsgate to pgen malin        8,271)  231321  from kingsgate to malin       38,705)  153771 from kingsgate to stanfield         1,988) suggested fix  change pgen kingsgate mapping from gdp-malin citygate to gdp-kingsgate. clay basin storage--this is really a fyi more than anything else--i see five different tickets in sitara for clay basin activity--one appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are injections  clay basin is valued as a questar curve which is substantially below nwpl points  what this means is that any time you are injecting gas these tickets will show transport losses each time you are withdrawing you will show big gains on transport  i\\'m not sure of the best way to handle this since we don\\'t really have a systematic sitara way of handling storage deals  in an ideal world it seems that you would map it the way you have it today but during injection times the transport cost would pass through as storage costs  anyway here\\'s the detail on the tickets just for your info plus i noticed three days where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from clay basin  there may be an operational reason why this occurred that i\\'m not aware of and the dollar impact is very small but i thought i\\'d bring it to your attention just in case there\\'s something you want to do about it  the columns below show the volumes under each ticket and the p&l associated with each  deal

subject re sw gas  mike mcdonald and i met with sw gas this morning  they were polite regarding asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to listen to a proposal  however they are very interested in weather hedges to protect throughput related earnings  we are pursuing a confidentiality agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable us to develop proposals  our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function procurement and by reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a weather product.as to your other question  we have yet to identify or pursue other candidates however mike mcdonald and i are developing a coverage strategy to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our opportunities  we met with 8 entities this week 7 municipals and swg as we implement our strategy in california.are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset management deal that we should approach  otherwise we intend to systematically identify and work through all the candidates laird laird, did you meet with swg on april

27th to discuss asset management  in preparation for that meeting we would like to gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with sw  could you in general terms describe our sales activities with sw  what are typical quantities and term on sales  are there any services we provide  how much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them  who are your main contacts at sw gas?we will propose to provide a full requirements supply to sw involving our control of their assets  for this to be attractive to sw we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions  this will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio fixed indexed collars should look like  offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk  that risk may not be acceptable to the desk  i will do some investigation of their pga\\'s and see if there is an opportunity.as to the asset management  do you have any preference on structure  are there elements that you would like to see  any ideas at all would be greatly appreciated.thanks,laird kay  neal,thanks for remembering my birthday  you beat my parents by one day  the family is doing fine  grace is really smiling  she is a very happy baby as long as she is

color stain 4lbs per yd x 100 yds x 18 lb 7200.00> these are above and beyond the cost of the concrete.> actual result took a truck and trailer to mexico and handpicked sautillotiles for inside the house changed the color of the cement on the porch to 1lbper yd mix color added the overrun tiles we had left over as stringers in theporch and accented with acid etched stain.> tiles and transportation 3000.00 labor mastic and beer tile setting did it myself 1400.00 acid stain for porch  350.00 davis pigment 15 x 40 yds  600.00> i can get you the info on the stain if you like i

subject california update 5/4/01if you have any questions please contact kristin walsh at 713 853-9510.bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8th deadline due to lack of supportsources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance/bridge loan by the may 8th deadline   any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart  according to sources both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis  the democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for davis  many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund davis would double dip into the fund  clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor  however it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take place  additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 2001  if not the state may be in breach of contract  sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8th having a bond issuance by july 1st will be very difficult.the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately 8 billion  however the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this concession  sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward.currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan ab 8x and ab 31x  ab 8x authorizes the dwr to sell up to 10 billion in bonds  this bill passed the senate in march but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support  ab 31x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts  however sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen currently in ab 8x  senator  bowen\\'s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be likely to cause a socal  bankruptcy  according to sources close to the republicans in  the legislature republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund  for instance tony  strickland has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds or approximately 5 billion  should be issued  other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds  the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  monday  additionally lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may  back out of the bridge loan. key points of the bridge financinginitial loan amount 4.125 blenders  jp morgan  2.5 b   lehman brothers  1.0 b   bear stearns  625 mtax exempt portion of the 4.125 b 1.6 b is expected to be tax-exemptprojected interest rate taxable rate  5.77%   tax-exempt rate  4.77%current projected blended ir  5.38%maturity date  august 29 2001for more details please contact me at 713 853-9510bill sb 6x passed the senate yesterday but little can be done at this timethe senate passed sb 6x yesterday which authorizes 5  billion to create the california consumer power and conservation  authority    the 5 billion authorized under sb 6x is not the  same as the 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward  again the republicans are not in support of these authorizations  without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has  negotiated the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support   no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  sb 6x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power    also there is no staff defined purpose etc for  the california public power and conservation authority  however this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea  earlier in the crisis. socal edison and bankruptcyat this point two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy  the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor  the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15th however some decision will likely be made earlier  according to sources the state has yet to sign the mou with socal though socal has signed it  the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass  if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor  involuntary due to the lack operating cash  the second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond issuance would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31x bridge loan stating that the dwr would received 100 of its payments from ratepayers then the utilities would receive the residual amount  in other words the state will get paid before the utilities  if this language is included and passed by the legislature it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy  socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments. transwestern pipeline co posted new notice(s since our last check at 12/12/2000 12:18:01 pm the newest notice looks like: capacity constraint dec 12

tomorrow:power  discussion of ferc market monitoring and mitigation order in el00-95-12 and review of upcoming filingsgas response to subpoenas of socal edison in rp00-241 and upcoming itemsmisc.i will be unable to participate in the call tomorrow as i will be attending the senate energy and resource committee hearing on the elements of the ferc market monitoring and mitigation order. traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip  especially if you have to prepare a presentation  i would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings  i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.as far as the business meetings i think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not  too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn   the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format  my suggestion for where to go is austin  play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski\\'s  flying somewhere takes too much time. tim,mike grigsby is having problems with accessing the west power site  can you please make sure he has an active password  thank you,phillip reagan,just wanted to give you an update  i have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12  kipp flores is working on the construction drawings  at the same time i am pursuing fha financing  once the construction drawings are complete i will send them to you for a revised bid  your original bid was competitive and i am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.phillip jim,is there going to be a

ned,regarding the waha storage the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value  the following assumptions were made to establish our bid  5 daily injection capacity 10 daily withdrawal capacity 1 fuel injection only 0.01/mmbtu variable injection and withdrawal fees  also an undiscounted  june 01 to january 02 spread of 0.60 existed at the time of this bid.bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning june 01 based on above assumptions  0.05 mmbtu/month 0.60/year  demand charges only.i am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not  please call or email with comments.phillip allen  forwarded by phillip k allen on 04/25/2001 01:51 pm ray alvarez@enron04/25/2001

not directly between commissioners then among ferc staffers  never say never but i think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap  i base this belief in large part on what i heard at a luncheon i attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was ferc chairman curt hebert  although the chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the commission hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:price caps are almost never the right answerprice caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagescompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerany solution however short term that does not increase supply or reduce demand is not acceptableeight out of eleven western governors oppose price caps in that they would export california\\'s problems to the westthis is the latest intelligence i have on the matter and it\\'s a pretty strong anti price cap position  of course hebert is just one commissioner out of 3 currently on the commission but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking the item could be bumped off the agenda  hope this info helps  rayphillip k allen@ect04/25/2001 02:28 pmto ray alvarez/na/enron@enroncc  subject re this morning\\'s commission meeting delayed  are there behind closed

panel system  i would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design i showed you  in order to make it feasible within my budget i am sure it will take several iterations  the prospect of purchasing the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered  however my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.i realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale  i just want to assure you that i am going to build this house in the fall and i would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built.please email your cost estimates when complete.thank you,phillip allen phillip  kieth;?i completed the following

badeer@ect sean crandall/pdx/ect@ect mark fischer/pdx/ect@ect bill williams iii/pdx/ect@ect diana scholtes@ect subject caiso demand reductionphillip et al.,i have been digging into the answer to your question re demand reduction in the west  your intuition as to reductions seen so far e.g march 2001 vs march 2000 was absolutely correct  at this point it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the caiso control area after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors has fallen by about 6  this translates into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 mwa for last month march 2001 as compared with the previous year.looking forward into the summer i believe that we will see further voluntary reductions as opposed to forced reductions via rolling blackouts  other forecasters e.g pira are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 mwa making total year-on-year reduction  2,700-2,800 will come off starting in june  this scenario is not difficult to imagine as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand  given that the 6 decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market and that rates are now scheduled to increase i think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10 relative to last year  this would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 mwa in jun-aug  in addition a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation are being promoted by the state which can only increase the likelihood of meeting and perhaps exceeding the 3,500 mwa figure  finally the general economic slowdown in calif could also further depress demand or at least make the 3,500 mwa number that much more attainable.note that all the numbers i am reporting here are for the caiso control area only which represents about 89 of total calif load or 36-37 of wscc (u.s summer load  i think it is reasonable to assume that the non-iso portion of calif i.e ladwp and iid will see similar reductions in demand  as for the rest of the wscc that is a much more difficult call  as you are aware the pacific nw has already seen about 2,000 mwa of aluminum smelter load come off since dec and this load is expected to stay off at least through sep and possibly for the next couple of years if bpa gets its wish  this figure represents approx 4 of the non-calif wscc  several mining operations in the sw and rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production  i have not yet been able to pin down exactly how many mw this translates to but i will continue to research the issue  other large industrials may follow suit and the ripple effects from calif\\'s economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the west  while the rest of the wscc may not see the 10 reductions that i am expecting in calif i think we could easily expect an additional 2-3 on top of the 4 already realized or approx 1,000-1,500 mwa of further demand reduction in the non-calif wscc for this summer  this would bring the total reduction for the wscc including the 2,000 mwa aluminum load we have already seen to around 6,500-7,000 mwa when compared with last summer.i am continuing to research and monitor the situation and will provide you with updates as new or better information becomes available  meantime i hope this helps  please feel free to call 503-464-8671 if you have any questions or need any further information. lucy,here is the rentroll from last friday  the closing was to be this thursday but it has been delayed until friday april 20th  if you can stay on until

closing has been postponed  as i mentioned i am going to have cary kipp draw the plans for the residence and i will get back in touch with you once he is finished.regarding the multifamily project i am going to work with a project manager from san antonio  for my first development project i feel more comfortable with their experience obtaining fha financing  we are working with kipp flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings  your bid for the construction is competive with other construction estimates  i am still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local relationships  i will get back in touch with you once we have made the final determination on unit mix and site plan.phillip allen jacques,the amounts needed to fill in the blanks on exhibit b are as follows:kipp flores-total contract was 23,600 but 2,375 was paid and only 21,225 is outstanding.kohutek 2,150 cuatro 37,800george  larry paid 3,500 for the appraisal and i agreed to reimburse this amount.the total cash that keith and i will pay the sellers is 5,875 3,500 appraisal and 2,375 engineering    i couldn\\'t find any reference to this cash consideration to be paid by the buyers.let me know if i need to do anything else before you can forward this to the  sellers to be executed.phillip john,regarding the employment agreement mike declined without a counter  keith said he would sign for 75k cash/$250 equity  i still believe frank should receive the same signing incentives as keith  phillip thanks for the response  i think you are right that engaging an architect is the next logical step  i had already contacted cary kipp and sent him the floor plan.he got back to me yesterday with his first draft  he took my plan and improved it  i am going to officially engage cary to draw the plans  while he works on those i wanted to try and work out a detailed specification list  also i would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners  i will be in san marcos on friday april 13th  are there any homes near completion that i could walk through that day  also can you provide some references?once i have the plans and specs i will send them to you so you can adjust your bid  phillip do you have a distribution list to send this to all the traders.phillip forwarded by phillip k allen on 04/04/2001 07:11

stairwell located on the corner of bell  smith.) lucy,here is a final 12/01 rentroll for you to save  my only questions are:1  neil moreno in 21-he paid 120 on 11/24 but did not pay anything on 12/01  even if he wants to swich to bi-weekly he needs to pay at the beginning      of the two week period  what is going on?2  gilbert in 27-is he just late here is a file for 12/08 https://www4.rsweb.com/61045 jacquesi am out of the office for the rest of the week  have you ever seen anyone miss as much work as i have in the last 6 weeks  i assure you this is unusual for me.hopefully we can sign some documents on monday  call me on my cell phone if you need me.phillip reagan,i am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?what role would you play in obtaining financing  any experience with fha 221(d loans  although your fees are lower than george and larry i am still getting market quotes lower yet  i have received estimates structured as follows:  5  onsite expenses supervision clean up equipment  2 overhead  4 profiti just wanted to give you this initial feedback  i have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project  as you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate 219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21  i am not thrilled about such a low return  i think i need to find a way to get the total cost down to 10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31  any ideas?i realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections  i am not discounting those services   i will be out of the office for the rest of the week but i will call you early next week.phillip cary,here is the picture of the house i have in mind  i was going for a simplefarmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near wimberley.a few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:there will be a double porch across the back just like the frontno dormers metal roof)1/2 bath under stairsoverall dimensions are 55 by 40what i am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen  morecabinets maybe a different shaped island and a way to enlarge the pantry.reagansuggested that i find a way to make the exterior more attractive  i wantto keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks but i was thinking aboutbringing the leftside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.that might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco  also the frontporch wouldbe smaller.i have 3 bids from builders all around 325,000  i am ready to go aheadand have the plans done so i can spec out all the finishings and choose abuilder.i just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work  as i mentionedmy alternative is 0.60/ft  i thought that since i had a such a detailedsketch you might consider the job for less than the 6,000 that reaganallowed.phillip

quick response on the bid for the residence  below is a list of questions on the specs:1  is the framing lumber 2 yellow pine  wouldn\\'t fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same?2  what type of floor joist would be used  2x12 or some sort of factory joist?3  what type for roof framing  on site built rafters or engineered trusses?4  are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound  what type of insulation in floors and ceiling  batts or blown  fiberglass or cellulose?5  any ridge venting or other vents power or turbine)?6 did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides  i didn\\'t know the difference between an apron and a stool.7  do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking  double plywood or hardi board underlay?8  on the stairs did you allow for a bannister  i was thinking a partial one out of iron  only about 5 feet.9  i did not label it on the plan but i was intending for a 1/2 bath under the stairs a pedestal sink would probably work.10  are undermount sinks different than drop ins  i was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.11  1 or 2 a/c units  i am assuming 2.12  prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?13  no door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?14  exterior porches included in bid  cedar decking on upstairs  iron railings?15  what type of construction contract would you use  fixed price except for change orders?i want to get painfully detailed with the specs before i make a decision but this is a start  i think i am ready to get plans drawn up  i am going to call cary kipp tosee about setting up a design meeting to see if i like his ideas.phillipi  larry,jacques has sent a document to claudia for your review  just dropping you a line to confirm that you have seen it.phillip can you please review the following systems presented in this spreadsheet for your group and let us know if you in fact use all these systems  the west gas includes west gas trading west gas originations and the denver piece combined  also we need for you to give us the breakout for the applicable groups  please let me know if you have any questions.tiffany miller5-8485 jacques,would it be ok if i signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and architect  they have both sent me agreements  the only paymentthat george and larry had made was 2,350 to the architect  i have written personal checks in the amounts of 25,000 to the architect and 13,950 to the engineer.i was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the partnership  i would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the partnership not with me  should i wait until the partnership has been conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.let me know what you think.phillip  forwarded by phillip k allen on 03/27/2001 02:29 pm hunter s shively03/26/2001 10:01 amto phillip.k.allen@enron.comcc  subject   forwarded by

seem too low for construction 33.30/sf gross)/$36/sf (rentable)what do the cost for on-site general requirements  299,818 represent?will you review the builders profit and fees with me again  you mentioned 2 overhead 3    and 5 profit.why is profit only 4 why are the architect fees up to 200k  i thought they would be 80k.what is the 617k of profit allowance  is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost?total closing and application costs of 350k  that seems very high  who receives the 2 points  how much will be sunk costs if fha declines us?where is your 1  are you receiving one of the points on the loan?what is the status on the operating pro forma  my back of the envelope puts noi at 877k assuming 625/1br 1300/3br 950/2br 5 vacancy and 40 expenses  after debt service that would only leave 122k  the coverage would only be 1.16.talk to you this afternoon.phillip grif,please provide a temporary idphillip forwarded by phillip k allen on 03/26/2001 05:04

porches on front and rear granite counters in kitchens and baths tile floors in upstairs baths metal roof w gutters no dormers) cherry or maple cabinets in kitchen  baths solid wood interior doors windows fully trimmed crown molding in downstairs living areas 2x6 wall on west side undecided items include: vinyl or aluminum windows wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room exterior stucco w stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4 sides   i have faxed you the floor plans  the dimensions may be to small to read  the overall dimensions are 55 x 40  for a total of 4400 sq ft under roof but  only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage   are there any savings in the simplicity of the design  it is basically a box with a simple roof  line  call me if

forgot to ask you  do you know if hugo is planning to replatt using an administrative process which i understand is quicker than the full replatting process of 3 weeks?also let me know about the parking  the builder in san marcos believed the plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code  the townhomes across the street have a serious parking problem  they probably planned for the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.phillip keith holst sent you an email with the details jacques,the agreement looks fine   my only comment is that george and larry might object to the language that the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the project   technically that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required did i loan them 1,300,000  i thought it was less.regarding exhibit a the assets include  the land architectural plans engineering completed appraisal and soils study   most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants  i have been speaking directly to the architect engineer and soils engineer   i am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants  the obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above  do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and give consideration of 5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.phillip  forwarded by phillip k
